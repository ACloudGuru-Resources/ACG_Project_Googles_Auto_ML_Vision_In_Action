# Formatted data download instructions

You can download the dog images dataset formatted to have the photos relating in each dog breed into different folders from GitHub (here).

Once you’ve downloaded the formatted images, you can compress them (into a zipped folder) and upload them to Google AutoML as a dataset, just like we’ve done in the video.

Below are instructions on how to download the data from GitHub.

### 1. Go to the following GitHub URL: https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/ACG_Project_Googles_Auto_ML_Vision_In_Action.git

You should see a folder called data. If it’s there, go to the next step.

### 2. Copy the GitHub URL: https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/ACG_Project_Googles_Auto_ML_Vision_In_Action.git

Once you’ve copied the URL, open a terminal window, and change into the directory where you would like to store the data.

### 3. Run the command 

Once you’re in the folder you need to be in. Run the following command in the same terminal window.

`git clone https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/ACG_Project_Googles_Auto_ML_Vision_In_Action.git`

This will make a copy of this GitHub repository on your computer.

### 4. Verify the data

If the clone was successful, you should see a new folder with the name: `ACG_Project_Googles_Auto_ML_Vision_In_Action`

When you open the new folder, inside it should be another folder called `data`. 

The `data` folder will contain several different folders all labelled with different dog breeds. Within each of the folders will be images containing dogs with the same breed as the folder name.

### 5. Compress the data

If your `data` folder contains folders with different dog breeds and their images, you can compress it.

To compress it, right click on the `data` folder and select compress.

This will leave you with a new folder called `data.zip`.

### 6. Upload `data.zip`

Once you have `data.zip` you can upload it Google AutoML.
